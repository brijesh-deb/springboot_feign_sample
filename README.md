# springboot_feign_sample
- A sample showing usage of Feign Client with Spring-Boot
- Feign is a declarative HTTP client that helps
  - reduce boilerplate code, create an interface/contract, then Spring creates the original implementation on the fly
  - REST-based service call is abstracted from developers
  - if you want to customize the call, like encoding/decoding your request/response, you can do it with Feign in a declarative way
